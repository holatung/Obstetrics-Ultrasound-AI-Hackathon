# Obstetrics-Ultrasound-AI-Hackathon

This repository hosts a machine learning model designed to assist healthcare professionals in predicting the gender of a fetus from obstetrics ultrasound images. The model, developed as part of a research initiative, aims to serve as a supplementary tool for early, non-invasive fetal assessment, particularly in settings with limited access to specialized medical equipment or expertise.

# Project Overview

The core of this project is a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, a type of neural network particularly effective for image analysis. By leveraging a diverse dataset of anonymized images, the model learns to identify intricate visual patterns correlated with fetal gender.

# Key Features

Model Architecture: The CNN is constructed with a series of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for feature extraction, while the pooling layers reduce the dimensionality, making the model more robust and efficient.

Prediction Inference: The model provides a probabilistic output (e.g., 95% confidence of female) to give healthcare workers a transparent view of its certainty.

Ethical Considerations: This model is designed with a strong emphasis on responsible AI development in healthcare. The repository includes documentation on data privacy, model limitations, and the ethical guidelines for its use as a decision-support tool.

Technical Stack:

* Frameworks: TensorFlow / Keras
